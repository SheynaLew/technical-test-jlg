## With More Time

- I would make the InfoCards more responsive and work on accessiblity. At the moment, they are not responsive to mobile screens. I would reduce to font-size, make the cards and icons slightly smaller, and consider stacking them vertically (however, I feel that this would detract from the main content of the page, which should be the test, so I would lean towards removing the cards entirely rather than stacking them).
- I would have a styling variables file so that things like color are easily set and changed without the need to find every instance of the colour in the app.
- I would consider accessibilty: The colour of the questions number is not accessible at the moment and could cause issues
- I would set font size in the index.css, rather than individually across multiple css files.
